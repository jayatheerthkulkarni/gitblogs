            </p>

            <p>Beyond working on the planned microproject, engaging with the Git mailing list often involves looking into interesting bug reports or discussions. Recently, Piotr Siupa reported a peculiar behavior with <code>git add</code> involving pathspecs containing wildcards.</p>

            <p>The report outlined a simple scenario:</p>
            <pre><code>git init
touch 'foo' 'f*'  # Create two files: one named 'foo', one literally 'f*'
git add 'f*'      # Attempt to add files matching the wildcard</code></pre>

            <p>The expectation was that the <code>git add 'f*'</code> command should add both the literal file <code>f*</code> and the file <code>foo</code> (since 'foo' matches the wildcard 'f*'). However, Piotr observed that only the literal file <code>f*</code> was added on the first run. Running the *exact same* <code>git add 'f*'</code> command a second time would then correctly add the <code>foo</code> file. This inconsistency definitely warranted investigation.</p>

            <h2>Initial Analysis: The Matching Optimization Hypothesis</h2>

            <p>I could reproduce the behavior on Git v2.49, confirming Piotr's findings. My first step was to trace the execution path starting from <code>cmd_add</code> in <code>builtin/add.c</code>. The process generally involves:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identifying untracked files (<code>fill_directory</code>).</li>
                <li>Filtering these files based on the provided pathspec (<code>prune_directory</code>).</li>
                <li>Adding the filtered files to the index (<code>add_files</code>).</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The core of the filtering logic lies within <code>prune_directory</code>, which utilizes functions like <code>match_pathspec</code> and ultimately <code>do_match_pathspec</code> to compare directory entries against the pathspec list. A key detail is that these matching functions often share state, particularly an array (let's call it `seen`) to track which pathspec patterns have already found a match during a single directory scan.</p>

            <p>My initial hypothesis, outlined in a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/CA+rGoLd-bSbaqfswD+qVrCv1fvG69QX+3BO1htbPJtinFkEQAA@mail.gmail.com/T/#t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reply to Piotr</a>, focused on an optimization within <code>do_match_pathspec</code>:</p>

            <div class="email-quote">
                <p>"When 'do_match_pathspec' processes the literal file 'f*' against the pathspec item ''f*'', it calls 'match_pathspec_item'. This helper function likely returns a code like 'MATCHED_EXACTLY'... Consequently, 'do_match_pathspec' updates the 'seen' array for the ''f*'' pathspec to mark it as exactly matched..."</p>
                <p>"The problem arises when 'do_match_pathspec' processes the other file, 'foo', against the same pathspec item ''f*''. Before doing the actual comparison, it checks the 'seen' array and finds that the ''f*'' pathspec was already marked 'MATCHED_EXACTLY'... An optimization check like 'if (seen && seen[i] == MATCHED_EXACTLY)' then evaluates to true. This causes the loop to 'continue', skipping the call to 'match_pathspec_item' entirely for the 'foo' file..."</p>
                 <cite>- My initial analysis (April 12)</cite>
            </div>

            <p>This theory seemed plausible: the optimization assumes that once a pathspec finds an exact match, it doesn't need further checking against other files in that same scan. However, when the *pattern itself* (`'f*'`) is identical to a *literal filename* (`'f*'`), this optimization could prematurely prevent the pattern from acting as a wildcard for other files (`'foo'`) within the same operation.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting the Evidence: A Deeper Look at Pathspec Parsing</h2>

            <p>While the optimization theory explained the observed behavior, further digging and debugging (adding `fprintf` checks) revealed a different picture. The issue seemed to originate earlier, during the *parsing* of the pathspec itself, specifically within the <code>init_pathspec_item</code> function in <code>pathspec.c</code>.</p>

            <p>As detailed in a follow-up email</p>
            <div class="email-quote">
                <p>"...debugging output confirmed that the core issue seems to originate earlier, during the pathspec parsing phase. It revealed that when processing the input string 'f*' (without any explicit magic like :(glob)), the resulting pathspec_item.magic field does not have the [PATHSPEC_GLOB flag set]..."</p>
                <p>"Looking at the logic in init_pathspec_item, it seems the PATHSPEC_GLOB flag is generally only added to item->magic if: a) The user explicitly uses a magic prefix like :(glob)f*. b) A global setting like GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS_ENVIRONMENT is active."</p>
                <p>"The code does not appear to automatically set PATHSPEC_GLOB on item->magic simply based on scanning the content of the path string for unescaped *, ?, or [ characters if no explicit magic prefix is present."</p>
                <cite>- My revised analysis (April 12)</cite>
            </div>

            <h2>The Root Cause (or Design Consequence?)</h2>

            <p>This revised understanding shifted the focus. The problem wasn't necessarily a flaw in the `do_match_pathspec` optimization check. Instead, the behavior stemmed from the fact that the pathspec item created for the input `'f*'` *lacked the `PATHSPEC_GLOB` magic flag*. Without this flag, higher-level Git functions might treat the pathspec as literal by default, even though lower-level matching functions might still interpret the `*` character.</p>

            <p>The inconsistency arises because the interpretation of `'f*'` depends on whether the `PATHSPEC_GLOB` flag is set. When it's *not* set (the default for simple wildcards without explicit prefixes), Git's behavior can be ambiguous: sometimes treating it literally, sometimes allowing underlying functions to glob-match.</p>

            <p>Therefore, the observed issue appears to be less a bug in a specific conditional check and more a consequence of Git's current design where pathspec "magic" (like globbing, case-insensitivity, etc.) is generally opt-in via explicit prefixes (<code>:(glob)</code>, <code>:(icase)</code>) or environment variables, rather than being automatically inferred from the content of the pathspec string itself.</p>

            <p>This investigation was a great exercise in tracing code paths, forming hypotheses, and then revising them based on deeper debugging and understanding of core mechanisms like pathspec parsing and magic flags.</p>
