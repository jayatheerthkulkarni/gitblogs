            </p>

            <p>Sometimes, the simplest Git commands hide surprising complexity. A recent dive into a peculiar `git add` behavior turned into a fascinating exploration of pathspec matching internals, collaboration on the Git mailing list, and ultimately, a satisfying fix.</p>

            <p>This post walks through the journey of diagnosing and patching a bug where `git add` would disregard a wildcard if a filename matched the wildcard pattern literally.</p>

            <h2>The Unexpected Behavior</h2>

            <p>The issue was first reported by Piotr Siupa on the Git mailing list. He provided a crystal-clear minimal test case:</p>
            <pre><code>git init
touch 'foo' 'f*'  # Create two files: 'foo' and one literally named 'f*'
git add 'f*'      # Attempt to add files matching the wildcard</code></pre>

            <p>Intuitively, one would expect `git add 'f*'` to stage both `foo` and the literal `f*` file, as both match the wildcard pattern. However, the observed behavior was different: only the literal `f*` file was staged on the first run. Running the exact same `git add 'f*'` command a second time would then correctly stage `foo`.</p>

            <p>This inconsistency pointed towards a subtle bug within Git's handling of pathspecs during the `add` operation, rather than shell expansion issues (since the wildcard was quoted).</p>

            <h2>Initial Investigation: The `MATCHED_EXACTLY` Hypothesis</h2>

            <p>My initial dive into the `git add` codebase (primarily `builtin/add.c`) suggested the problem might lie in an optimization within the pathspec matching logic. The process roughly goes like this:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>`cmd_add` gathers untracked files (`foo` and `f*`).</li>
                <li>`prune_directory` filters these files using the provided pathspec (`'f*'`).</li>
                <li>This involves calling `do_match_pathspec`, which iterates through files and pathspec patterns.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Inside `do_match_pathspec`, a `seen` array tracks which pathspecs have already found a match. My hypothesis centered on this check:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-c">// Inside the loop within do_match_pathspec
if (seen && seen[i] == MATCHED_EXACTLY)
    continue; // Skip checking this pathspec item further</code></pre>

            <p>The theory was:
            <ul>
                <li>When processing the literal file `f*`, it matches the pathspec `'f*'` exactly.</li>
                <li>The `seen` array marks the `'f*'` pathspec as `MATCHED_EXACTLY`.</li>
                <li>When processing the `foo` file against the same `'f*'` pathspec, the code sees the `MATCHED_EXACTLY` flag and `continue`s, skipping the wildcard match for `foo`.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This explained why only `f*` was added initially. On the second run, `f*` was already tracked, so `foo` was processed normally against the wildcard.</p>


            <h2>Refining the Diagnosis: Pathspec Magic vs. Wildcards</h2>

            <p>While the `MATCHED_EXACTLY` optimization seemed involved, further debugging revealed it wasn't the root cause. Digging into `init_pathspec_item` (in `pathspec.c`) showed that Git distinguishes between pathspecs that *contain* wildcard characters and pathspecs that have explicit "magic" flags set (like `PATHSPEC_GLOB`).</p>

            <p>Crucially, just providing `'f*'` doesn't automatically set `PATHSPEC_GLOB` unless you use prefixes like `:(glob)f*` or environment variables. The optimization check I initially focused on wasn't the primary issue because the pathspec wasn't necessarily being treated with full "glob magic" at that level in the first place, despite containing a `*`.</p>

            <div class="email-quote">
                 <p>This highlighted a key aspect of Git's design: pathspec interpretation relies heavily on explicit flags rather than solely inferring behavior from the pattern string itself.</p>

            </div>


            <h2>The Breakthrough: Guidance from Jeff King (`nowildcard_len`)</h2>

            <p>Thankfully, Jeff King (Peff) chimed in on the mailing list thread, confirming the initial track was close but needed refinement. He pointed out that Git *does* track the presence of wildcards internally, just not via the `magic` flags in this context.</p>

            <p>The key is the `nowildcard_len` field in the `pathspec_item` struct. This field stores the length of the initial part of the pathspec string *before* any wildcard character (`*`, `?`, `[`). If `nowildcard_len` is equal to the total length (`len`) of the pathspec string, it means the pathspec contains no wildcards and is a literal.</p>

            <p>Peff suggested modifying the optimization check to incorporate this knowledge:</p>

            <div class="email-quote">
                <p>"I think you're still on the right track... compare [nowildcard_len] to 'len' to see if it does any globbing at all... So something like this probably works:"</p>

            <p>This refined check correctly distinguishes:
            <ul>
                <li>A true literal pathspec (like `'foo'`) that gets an exact match. Here, `nowildcard_len == len`, so the optimization can safely `continue`.</li>
                <li>A pathspec with wildcards (like `'f*'`) that happens to exactly match a literal filename (`f*`). Here, `nowildcard_len < len`, so the `continue` is *not* executed, allowing the same pathspec item to be evaluated against other files (like `foo`) for wildcard matches.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>The Fix and Patch Submission</h2>

            <p>Based on this guidance, the fix became clear. The final patch incorporated this check into `dir.c`:</p>

            <p>This ensures that wildcard pathspecs are always fully evaluated against all candidate files, even if one of those files happens to share the exact name as the pattern itself.</p>

            <p>The patch, along with explanations and credits, was formatted using `git format-patch` and submitted to the mailing list for review. You can view the final patch here: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250412094607.236382-2-jayatheerthkulkarni2005@gmail.com/T/#u" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patch 1/1 add: fix handling literal filenames and wildcards</a>.</p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pathspec matching in Git has subtle layers involving literal matching, wildcard expansion, and explicit "magic" flags.</li>
                <li>Seemingly simple optimizations can have unintended consequences in edge cases.</li>
                <li>The Git mailing list provides an invaluable platform for reporting bugs, discussing internals, and receiving guidance from experienced developers like Jeff King.</li>
                <li>Understanding internal data structures (like `struct pathspec_item` and its `nowildcard_len` field) is often key to diagnosing complex behavior.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This bug hunt was a great learning experience, reinforcing the importance of clear test cases, persistent debugging, and leveraging the collective knowledge of the Git community.</p>

             <h3>Pro Tip</h3>
             <p>If you need to reliably match files using wildcards, especially in scripts or complex scenarios, consider using the explicit `:(glob)` prefix (e.g., `git add ':(glob)f*'`). If you need to add a file whose name literally contains a wildcard character, escape it: `git add 'f\*'`.</p>
